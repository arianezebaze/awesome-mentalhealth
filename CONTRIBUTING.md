# Contributing

When contributing please keep in mind the end user. We don't like expensive products, but we won't list prices or mark free/premium resources. If it helps people it helps!

When linking to books, please provide a Google Books link. When linking to the web resource, please try to use HTTPS where possible.

There are some language specific additions to this list; We wouldn't like to maintain resources we can't read ourselves. So main contributions should be in English, but we can verify resources in several european languages.
If you have resources in the following languages feel free to add them.

- Afrikaans
- Danish
- Dutch
- English
- French
- Frisian
- German
- Norwegian
- Spanish
- Swedish
